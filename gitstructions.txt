git instructions

make a change to a script

Save it

in git shell

git add <filename>
git commit -m "text to describe the change"
git push origin master


local working directory (where you work on your files) --> staging area (where your commits are saved) --> local git repository --> github (the github website)

"git add" moves a file to staging
"git commit" moves a file to local git repository
"git push" moves a file to github

git diff # will tell you what's different between local repository and staging area
